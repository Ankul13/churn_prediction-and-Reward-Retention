ðŸ§  Customer Churn Prediction & Reward Retention System
This project focuses on identifying potential churners among credit card users using machine learning and proactively reducing churn by offering personalized rewards based on past spending behavior.

ðŸš€ Objective
To predict customer churn using transaction data and implement a retention strategy by:

Clustering customers based on spending behavior.

Predicting churn using a machine learning model.

Offering targeted rewards to high-risk customers based on their historical spending categories.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset contains anonymized customer credit card transaction data with features such as:

Balance, purchase frequency, one-off and installment purchases

Cash advances, payment behavior, tenure

A CHURN label indicating whether the customer left or stayed

ðŸ§© Project Modules
1. Clustering (clustering.ipynb)
Goal: Group customers based on their credit card spending behavior.

Method: Applied KMeans clustering on features such as:

BALANCE, PURCHASES, CASH_ADVANCE, TENURE, etc.

Result: Segmented users into different behavioral groups for better reward targeting.

2. Churn Prediction (chrun-prediction.ipynb)
Goal: Predict whether a customer will churn.

Model: Random Forest Classifier

Preprocessing:

Dropped irrelevant or highly missing columns (CUST_ID, MINIMUM_PAYMENTS, etc.)

Scaled and cleaned the data

Accuracy Achieved: ~96%

3. Reward System (reward-system.ipynb)
Goal: Offer rewards to predicted churn customers to encourage retention.

Logic:

Analyze the last spending type (e.g., electronics, groceries, dining)

Match with appropriate offers like:

50â€“70% off next online purchase

Free grocery item

Buy 1 Get 1 on clothing

30% off dining

Free movie tickets

Result: Personalized retention offers based on real behavior
